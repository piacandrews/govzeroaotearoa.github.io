As we get started, we'll keep a list here of current projects that members of our community are working on. We'll add some automation and sctructure to this over time but for now, please just check out and contribute your own links below:

- [Exploring optimistic and pessimistic futures](https://govzeroaotearoa.github.io/futures) - the purpose of this project is to dream big, with diverse communities from across Aotearoa New Zealand, so we can co-create a light on the hill to walk towards, together. People can't change to what they can't imagine, so we need to dream a little if we want to get somewhere fundamentally better in future.
- [Rules as Code]() - the purpose of this project is to build a public, community-managed repository of legislation and regulation as code, for anyone to use to build new services, to test against, and to help improve traceability to law and access to justice.
